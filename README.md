Hi Tim,

As promised, here is the material to start reading when you have some time (there is no rush since we will start on September 25th).
Keep in mind that you donâ€™t have to go through everything, as it is a lot of stuff :)

- Normalizing flows in general:
    - [1] repo containing link to the main resources, regularly updated (most of the stuff I mention in what follows is reported here as well)
    - [2] a presentation that Davide did at an ETH group meeting, with stuff from the papers already pre-digested (quite similar to the one you linked)
    - [3] interesting introductory paper 
    - [4] another interesting interesting introductory paper
    - [5] main paper about Neural Spline Flows, which is the main kind of transform used in what I've done so far
- Flows4Flows (i.e. the method I'm trying to tune to perform the corrections):
    - [6] paper
    - [7] gh repo
- CQR (i.e. the method already in place and that we're trying to "upgrade" using NFs)
    - [8] Higgs -> gamma gamma differential cross sections paper, see 4.2.1
- Code
    - [9] main repo where I've been implementing the procedure (there are multiple branches due to the different attempts - don't worry too much about it now since it will require deeper explanation)
    - [10] package containing the flows we're using now 
    - [11] another package that we might investigate

On top of this, I will soon add to a repo some small prototypes that I have used here and there to study the problem without using the full setup - which are probably the best place where to start.
Of course I will explain most of this in much better detail when we will start.

Cheers,
Massimiliano
